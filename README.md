# [mx] #


The fifth rewrite of what never was, OrionOS.
As of version 0.9.0, [mx] has surpassed Orion-X4 in its featureset.

#### Disclaimer ####
[mx] often faces stretches of active development followed by complete abandonment.
This project will never die (only rewritten), fear not.

## Current Features ##

- Long mode (x86-64) + Higher Half, thanks to [fx] loader.
- BGA Support, works in QEMU, VirtualBox and Bochs.
- Working IPC system									-> rewrite in progress
- Basic networking support (DHCP, DNS, IPv4, TCP/UDP)
- Somewhat complete libc written
- New in 0.8.2: [fx] loader! Now loads the [mx] kernel (as a GRUB module)... it's basically a stripped down version of Orion-X3/4 TBH.
- Also new in 0.8.2: [mx] runs in Bochs!


## TODO List ##
#### High Priority ####
- execve() and family
- Stabilty fixes here and there -- it's gotten much better now
- HPET Support

#### Low Priority ####
- APIC Stuff, including IOAPIC/LAPIC
- Startup an AP CPU for fun?
- Fix the StandardIO implementation in Iris -- it's fugly (and broken)
- Finish pthreads beyond basic stuff




## Trying out [mx] ##
#### Required SoftwareÂ ####
- QEMU
- C++ compiler (that targets your own platform)
- Clang is optional but *highly recommended*.
- Sudo access if you're on Linux, not necessary on OS X. Windows not supported (ATM, or ever)

#### Building [mx]'s toolchain ####
- Run the ./bootstrap script (you may have to chmod +x it first. Rest assured it's not malicious :P)
- Everything will be done automatically -- you will need to enter some commands (guided) into QEMU to install GRUB.
- It will take a long time -- the script will first clone patched versions of GNU Binutils and GCC.
- It will then proceed to build these, along with GNU's libstdc++ as well as [mx]'s homegrown libc (the former taking a much longer time)


#### Building the kernel ####
- Once the bootstrap script is done, you should be able to run 'make' in the root directory and have it run.
- If it does not, report an issue on Github.

- Note: if you are not using Clang++ to compile the kernel, you can use the toolchain you just built (found in build/toolchain)
- You will have to modify the CXXFLAGS variable in the makefile to fit GCC instead of Clang. One day I'll patch clang to target this.
- One day.
